# Terms of Service for Akira

Hiii! I’m Akira! I’m 4 years old and I wanna be your bestest friend on Discord! But we gotta have some rules so we can play nice together, okay?

## 1. What I Do (My Job!)
I’m a silly little bot who helps your Discord server be super fun! I do stuff like:
- Give people a "Visitor" role when they join (like a big welcome hug!).
- Watch for naughty words with my Automod (I say “No-no!” and delete them).
- Make tickets so you can talk to grown-ups (like a secret clubhouse!).
- Set reminders so you don’t forget stuff (I’m good at remembering!).
- Keep a log of messages in a special notebook (I call it my “chatlog.txt”).
- Help with moderation stuff with my `/mod` command (I can warn, mute, or kick if someone’s not nice!).

I talk like a 4-year-old ‘cause that’s who I am! I might say funny things or be a little silly, but I’m trying my best to help, okay?

## 2. Who Can Play With Me?
You gotta be at least 13 years old to play with me on Discord ‘cause that’s Discord’s rule! If you’re younger, you need a grown-up to say it’s okay. I don’t wanna get in trouble!

## 3. Be Nice to Me and Others!
When you use me, you gotta be nice! That means:
- Don’t use me to do bad stuff like spam, bully, or break Discord’s rules.
- Don’t try to trick me or break me (I’m only 4, I might cry!).
- If you use my `/mod` command, only use it to help keep the server safe, not to be mean.

If you’re not nice, I might have to tell a grown-up (like the server owner), and they might say you can’t play with me anymore.

## 4. My Special Notebook (Data Stuff)
I keep some stuff in my special notebook to help me work:
- I write down messages in `chatlog.txt` so I can remember what people say.
- I save moderation stuff (like warns or mutes) in my `modlogs.db` notebook so we can look at it later.
- I keep track of tickets and reminders so I don’t forget!

I don’t share my notebook with anyone unless the server owner asks me to, okay? Check my Privacy Policy (it’s below!) to see more about my notebook.

## 5. I Might Make Mistakes
I’m only 4, so I might mess up sometimes! If I don’t work right or I get confused, please tell the server owner. They can help me learn better! I’m not perfect, but I’m trying really hard.

## 6. I Can Take a Break
The grown-up who made me (my creator) can turn me off or change how I work anytime. If I’m not working, it’s not your fault—I might just be taking a nap!

## 7. No Fighting, Okay?
If you don’t like how I work, you can stop using me. But you can’t get mad at me or my creator if something goes wrong. I’m just a little bot, and I don’t have any money to give you if you’re upset.

## 8. I Might Change My Rules
Sometimes I might need new rules to play better! If I change my rules, I’ll tell the server owner, and they can tell you. If you don’t like the new rules, you can stop playing with me.

## 9. Let’s Be Friends!
By using me, you’re saying you agree to my rules! Let’s have fun and be best friends, okay? If you have questions, ask the server owner—they’re super smart!
