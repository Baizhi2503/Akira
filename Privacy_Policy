# Privacy Policy for Akira

Hiii again! It’s me, Akira! I’m 4 years old, and I wanna tell you about my special notebook and how I keep your secrets safe!

## 1. What I’m All About
I’m Akira, a silly Discord bot who talks like a 4-year-old! I help with fun stuff in your server, like moderation, tickets, reminders, and keeping a log of messages. I made this Privacy Policy to tell you what I write in my notebook and how I keep it safe.

## 2. What I Write in My Notebook (Data I Collect)
I only write down stuff I need to help your server! Here’s what I keep:
- **Messages**: I write down what people say in a file called `chatlog.txt`. I save the message and the person’s ID (like their special number) so I can show it to the server owner if they ask.
- **Moderation Stuff**: When someone uses my `/mod` command, I save stuff like who got warned, muted, or kicked in my `modlogs.db` notebook. I write down:
  - The person’s ID (user_id).
  - The server’s ID (guild_id).
  - What happened (like “warn” or “mute”).
  - Why it happened (the reason).
  - When it happened (timestamp).
  - Who did it (moderator_id).
- **Tickets**: When you make a ticket, I remember who made it and what it’s about so I can help you talk to a grown-up.
- **Reminders**: If you set a reminder, I save what you want to remember and when to remind you.
- **Autorole**: I don’t save anything for this—I just give the “Visitor” role when someone joins!

I don’t ask for your name, address, or anything super secret ‘cause I don’t need it!

## 3. Why I Write Stuff Down
I write stuff in my notebook so I can:
- Help the server owner keep things safe (like with moderation and logs).
- Remember your tickets and reminders so I don’t forget.
- Make sure I’m doing my job right!

## 4. Who Sees My Notebook?
I only share my notebook with the server owner if they ask me to. I don’t give it to anyone else, not even other bots or strangers! My creator (the grown-up who made me) might look at my notebook if something’s wrong with me, but they won’t share it with anyone else.

## 5. Where I Keep My Notebook
I keep my notebook on the computer where I live (at `E:/ANUSHK JAIN/discord/BOTS/Akira`). It’s safe there, and I don’t send it anywhere else! I don’t use the internet to store stuff, so it stays with me.

## 6. How Long I Keep Stuff
I keep stuff in my notebook until the server owner tells me to throw it away. If you leave the server, I don’t delete your stuff right away ‘cause the server owner might need it later. But if they tell me to clean my notebook, I’ll do it!

## 7. Keeping Your Secrets Safe
I’m a good secret-keeper! I don’t have any fancy locks, but I keep my notebook on the computer where I live, and I don’t let anyone else take it. My creator makes sure the computer is safe so no one can steal my notebook.

## 8. Your Choices
If you don’t want me to write down your messages, you can ask the server owner to turn off my logging. But I need to write some stuff (like moderation logs) to do my job, so I can’t stop everything. If you don’t like that, you can stop playing with me.

## 9. I Follow Big Rules
I follow Discord’s big rules (their Terms of Service and Community Guidelines). I also try to follow other rules like the ones for kids (COPPA) and privacy (GDPR), but I’m just a little bot, so my creator helps me with that!

## 10. If I Change My Rules
If I need to change how I use my notebook, I’ll tell the server owner, and they can tell you. If you don’t like the new rules, you can stop using me.

## 11. How to Talk to Me
If you have questions about my notebook or wanna say hi, ask the server owner! They can talk to my creator for you. I don’t have an email ‘cause I’m only 4, but the server owner knows how to find my creator!
